# PacketBlocks

A Spigot/Paper library for creating and managing **client-side (packet-based) blocks**.  
PacketBlocks lets you display blocks to players without modifying the real world, while still providing APIs for interaction, metadata, block breaking, and per-player visibility.

---

## Features
- Spawn blocks visible only to specific players.
- Fully per-player block states (`BlockData`, suppliers, metadata).
- Break simulation (`PacketBlockBreakEvent`) with configurable item drops.
- Per-viewer visibility conditions (filters).
- Utilities for bounding boxes, collision handling, and animations.
- Automatic viewer management.

---

## Requirements
- **Server:** Paper 1.21+ (or a compatible fork)
- **Java:** 21+
- **Dependency:** [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) `2.9.5+`

---

## Installation

This project is **not published to a repository host**. You must clone it and install manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BitByLogics/PacketBlocks.git
cd PacketBlocks
mvn clean install
```

This will install the library into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`).  
You can then add it as a dependency in your plugin project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.bitbylogic</groupId>
    <artifactId>packetblocks</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

---

## Quick Start

```java
Location loc = player.getLocation().add(0, 0, 1);
BlockData blockData = Bukkit.createBlockData(Material.DIAMOND_BLOCK);

// Create the packet block
PacketBlock packetBlock = new PacketBlock(loc, blockData);

// Make it visible to a player
packetBlock.addAndUpdateViewer(player);

// Update for all viewers
packetBlock.setBlockDataForAll(Material.GOLD_BLOCK.createBlockData());

// Simulate break (fires PacketBlockBreakEvent and drops items by default)
packetBlock.simulateBreak(player);
```

---

## Simulate breaks & drops
`simulateBreak(...)` triggers `PacketBlockBreakEvent`. This event:
- Is cancellable.
- By default, **will drop items based on the `BlockState` and tool used**.
- If you do **not** want items to drop, call `event.setDropItems(false)` in your event listener.

## PacketBlockManager Overview

The `PacketBlockManager` is the main API for managing PacketBlocks on the server. You can get the manager using:

```java
PacketBlockManager blockManager = PacketBlocks.getInstance().getBlockManager();
```

Some important methods:

- `createBlock(Location location, BlockData blockData)`  
  Creates a new PacketBlock at the specified location.

- `removeBlock(PacketBlock packetBlock)`  
  Removes a block and resets the world block for all viewers.

- `removeIf(Predicate<PacketBlock> removePredicate)`  
  Removes blocks that match a given condition.

- `getBlock(Location location)`  
  Gets the PacketBlock at a specific location, if it exists.

- `getBlocks(World world)`  
  Gets all PacketBlocks in a world.

- `getBlocks(World world, int chunkX, int chunkZ)`  
  Gets all PacketBlocks in a specific chunk.

- `getBlocksByViewer(Player player)`  
  Gets all PacketBlocks currently visible to a player.

- `getBlocksByViewerWithMeta(Player player, String metaKey)`  
  Gets all PacketBlocks visible to a player that contain a specific metadata key.
